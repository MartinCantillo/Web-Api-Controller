# ASP.NET Core Web API for Pizza Management

In this project, an ASP.NET Core web API has been developed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of pizzas stored in an in-memory cache.

## Summary

In this module, an ASP.NET Core web API running on .NET has been created. The web API creates, reads, updates, and deletes pizzas from an in-memory cache.

You've learned that creating an ASP.NET Core web API involves:

- Creating a new application using the ASP.NET Core web API template.
- Creating classes that inherit from the ControllerBase class and contain methods that respond to HTTP requests.

Since this pattern allows you to focus on one controller action at a time, it's possible to create functional web APIs fairly quickly with a little practice.

In this module, an in-memory cache has been used. This approach has helped you focus on learning web API concepts but has some obvious limitations for real-world applications. If the application stops, all changes are lost.
